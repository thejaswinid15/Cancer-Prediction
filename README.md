Cancer classification using gene expression data is a critical area of research with the potential to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes. This study explores various machine learning techniques to classify five types of cancer: BRCA, COAD, KIRC, LUAD, and PRAD, based on gene expression profiles. The dataset comprises 20530 gene features, providing a rich source of information for predictive modeling. By applying methods such as K-Means clustering, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, we aim to identify the most effective approach for distinguishing between different cancer types. The preprocessing steps involved merging gene expression data with corresponding labels, addressing missing values, and standardizing features to ensure optimal model performance. This research underscores the potential of machine learning in enhancing cancer classification through the analysis of complex genomic data.
